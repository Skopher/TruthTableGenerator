This is a small project I am using to explore / have-fun with 
Logical Form and Logical Equivalence in my computer science
courses. 

What I would intend is that this provides a complete truth table
for a given boolean function. May or may not be useful, but will
be fun and a good opportunity to learn reflection and parsing.
